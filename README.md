# brave-bg
Brave is a really nice chromium-based browser and I happily recommend any internet user to use it. Unlike other browsers, however, you unforunately cannot change your newtab background. It's a not a huge problem, but still a nice feature to have, particularly considering some of the random backgrounds that do not look very nice. 

## What is this?
The ability to change the background has always been one that I really wanted. After realizing the feature probably won't come anytime soon, I resorted to writing some shit code using my three brain cells to do this via brave/chrome extensions. 

## Files:
- `/manifst.json` | Includes the information the browser needs to use the extension.
- `/newtab.html` | Garbage html code that replaces the normal newtab with this, an easily customizable one. 

## Procedure
1 - Download the source by clicking on the green "Code" button and then clicking "Download ZIP".
2 - Unzip the folder and then move it to a directory or location where it likely won't be deleted. 
3 - In the html file, you'll see a body css and get rid of the link I put with the link of a background you want.
4 - Go into Brave and type `brave://extensions/` into the adress bar.
5 - click the "load unpacked" button on the top left corner.
6 - Look for the source you downloaded and select it. 
7 - Enable it.
